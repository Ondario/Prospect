# Prospect Game Server - Project Overview

## Current State
This project is a reverse engineering effort to create a dedicated server for the Unreal Engine-based game "Prospect". The codebase contains a substantial networking framework reimplementation and several related components. **MAJOR UPDATE**: Complete game assets have been extracted to the `Exports/` folder via FModel, providing access to all maps, configurations, and game data.

## Core Components

### 1. Prospect.Server.Game (Game Server)
**Status**: Networking foundation complete, requires asset system and actor implementation

**Current Implementation**:
- **Program.cs**: Main entry point with 60 FPS tick loop and environment-based configuration
- **ProspectWorld.cs**: Minimal world wrapper extending UWorld (7 lines)
- **Client.cs**: Test client implementation with UIpNetDriver connectivity

**Key Features**:
- Configurable server (port 7777, multiple map support: Station, BrightSands, CrescentFalls, TharisIsland)
- UIpNetDriver-based UDP networking with full packet handling pipeline
- Connection handshaking, challenge/response authentication
- Environment variable configuration (SERVER_PORT, DEFAULT_MAP, GAME_MODE)
- Real-time packet processing and network tick management

**Critical Missing Components**:
- **Asset Loading System**: No integration with extracted game assets (.uasset files)
- **Map Data Loading**: Hardcoded map paths need actual level geometry and spawn points
- **Actor Spawning**: PlayerController creation stubbed, no actual game object instantiation
- **Physics Integration**: No collision detection or movement validation
- **Steam Networking**: Client compatibility requires USteamNetDriver or IP connection testing

**Network Compatibility Issues**:
- Current UIpNetDriver may not support Steam-based clients
- Requires testing with `open IP:PORT` commands for direct client connection
- SteamNetDriver implementation needed for full client compatibility

### 2. Prospect.Unreal (Networking Framework)
**Status**: Comprehensive networking layer implementation - ~70% complete

**Core Classes**:
- **UWorld**: Game world management with actor initialization and network notification handling
- **UIpNetDriver**: UDP-based network driver with connection management
- **UNetConnection**: Connection state management and packet processing
- **UChannel**: Channel-based communication (Control, Voice, Actor channels)

**Network Protocol Support**:
- Control message handling (Hello, Welcome, Challenge, Login, Join, etc.)
- Reliable/unreliable packet transmission
- Channel-based communication
- Packet acknowledgment and retry logic
- Stateless connection handshaking

### 3. Prospect.Server.Api (Backend Services)
**Status**: Complete PlayFab-compatible backend implementation

**Features**:
- Authentication (Steam, Entity-based)
- CloudScript function execution
- Database integration (MongoDB)
- Squad/friend management
- SignalR real-time communication
- Store/inventory management

## Multiplayer Architecture

### Connection Flow
1. Client connects via UDP to game server
2. Stateless handshake challenge/response
3. Hello message exchange with version verification
4. Login authentication (currently stubbed)
5. Welcome message with level/gamemode information
6. Join message to spawn PlayerController
7. Actor replication begins

### Current Limitations

**Critical Missing Components**:
1. **Asset Loading System** ⭐ **TOP PRIORITY** - C# JSON parser for Unreal asset format
   - Parse 27MB MAP01 level data
   - Grid-based streaming system implementation
   - Asset reference resolution between JSON files
2. **Actor Spawning System** - Parse GP/ files to spawn game objects at correct locations
3. **Player Spawn Implementation** - Use distance-based scoring system from map config
4. **Data Table Loading** - Dynamic loading of game configuration from JSON tables
5. **Steam Network Driver** - Client compatibility for real player connections

**Asset Implementation Gaps**:
- No JSON-to-C# asset pipeline
- Missing Unreal Blueprint → C# logic conversion
- No level streaming or world partitioning system
- Incomplete actor component system

## Technical Debt

1. **Hardcoded Values**: Map names, game modes, network versions
2. **TODO Comments**: 50+ unimplemented features marked
3. **Exception Handling**: Many `NotImplementedException` calls
4. **Memory Management**: Potential memory leaks in connection handling
5. **Testing**: Minimal test coverage for networking components

## Dependencies

**External Packages**:
- Serilog (logging)
- MongoDB.Driver (database)
- Microsoft.AspNetCore (web API)
- SignalR (real-time communication)

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Prospect.Unreal → Core networking primitives
- Prospect.Server.Game → Prospect.Unreal
- Prospect.Server.Api → Independent backend services
